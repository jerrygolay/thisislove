# ThisIsLove

This is my first project 
In this repo I will put all my love for the humanity

## And comme dirait l'autre 

My love for you is like the raging sea,
So powerful and deep it will forever be.
Through storm, wind, and heavy rain,
It will withstand every pain

I wake up every day with your smile on my mind.
It's a beautiful sight to behold, so soft and so kind.
My dreams are filled with the thought of me and you.
I awake and smile, for my dreams have come true.

Love is like a river,
A never ending stream.
Love is shared by each other
To answer someone's dream
